# Coral Shield Project

## Overview
Coral Shield is a synthetic biology project aimed at protecting coral reefs from the harmful effects of oxybenzone, 
a common ingredient in sunscreen that contributes to coral bleaching. This repository contains the biological 
circuit designs and the SimBiology model files used to simulate and validate the efficacy of the oxybenzone 
detection and degradation system.

## Repository Structure
## Biological Circuit
The biological circuit included in this project is designed to detect the presence of oxybenzone and 
activate an enzymatic response that degrades this compound, thus mitigating its harmful effects on coral reefs. 
The design files can be found in the `/BiologicalCircuit` directory.

## SimBiology Model
The SimBiology model simulates the interactions within the biological circuit in response to oxybenzone presence in a marine environment. 
It uses detailed reaction kinetics and has been parameterized based on laboratory and literature data. To run the simulations, 
navigate to the `/SimBiologyModel` directory.
